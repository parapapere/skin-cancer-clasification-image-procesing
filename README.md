# Skin Cancer Classification with Image Processing and Machine Learning

This project employs image processing techniques and machine learning for the classification of skin cancer. Dataset: [Skin Cancer: Malignant vs. Benign](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fanconic/skin-cancer-malignant-vs-benign)

## Key Features

1. **Data Processing and Exploration:**
   - Google Colab is utilized to access and preprocess skin cancer images stored on Google Drive.
   - Image features, including color statistics, gradients, and contour properties, are extracted for analysis.

2. **Machine Learning Model:**
   - A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is employed for skin cancer classification.
   - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to reduce feature dimensionality.

3. **Image Analysis Techniques:**
   - Various image processing techniques, such as histogram analysis, filtering, and thresholding, are demonstrated.
   - Edge detection methods (Sobel, Laplace, Canny) and K-Means clustering for image segmentation are showcased.

4. **Data Visualization:**
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) includes correlation matrices and pair plots to visualize relationships between features.
